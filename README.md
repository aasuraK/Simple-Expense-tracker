This is a simple web application that allows users to track their expenses. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the help of the Bootstrap framework.

The user can enter the amount spent, the item or service purchased, and a description of the purchase into a form. When the user clicks the submit button, the data is saved to the browser's localStorage, which allows the data to persist even after the user closes the browser.

The app also has functionality to edit and delete saved expenses. When the edit button is clicked, the data is retrieved from localStorage and pre-populated into the form fields. The user can then update the data and save it back to localStorage by clicking the submit button, which has been dynamically updated to say "Update".

The delete button simply removes the saved expense from localStorage.

Overall, this app provides a simple and effective way for users to keep track of their expenses.
